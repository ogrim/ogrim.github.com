I love the new version of the [Opera][1] web browser. If my memory is correct (it sometimes is) I have been using Opera for about 8 years. They do like to change things up, innovate and think differently. This is often for the better, giving us new and exiting features, for instance the [Speed Dial][2]. They changed up a lot of things for version 11, but there is one change I did not like: hiding the URL parameters.

I found a solution for this problem in the opera.beta newsgroup, and it is dead simple: enter `opera:config#UserPrefs|HideURLParameter` in the address bar, uncheck the highlighted field and press save in the bottom. Done. Now URLs will not be truncated in the address bar!
