This I noticed when playing Scotland Yard with some friends during the summer. I figured I could make a helper program to remember and predict moves, and try to find ways to solve the game when Mr. X reveals his position. The programming language I am working in is Prolog, as it is very simple to represent the nodes in the graph with little syntax. The fun will start when I start writing predicates to search in the graph.
