There is a issue with KeePass in Ubuntu 10.10. As I had to fix this on several computers, I am posting the solution here. It was somewhat [inconvenient to track down][1].

Run this command in the terminal:
	sudo apt-get install libmono-winforms2.0-cil libmono-system-runtime2.0-cil

Earlier you only needed to install the winforms package to run KeePass, but with Ubuntu 10.10 it seems you need the system-runtime as well.
